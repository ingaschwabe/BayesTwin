This map contains a manual of BayesTwin, an example analysis using simulated data (see exampleanalysis.html).

Depending on the sample-size and number of items included in the analysis, the analysis is computationally intensive and can take several hours to complete. In this case, it is recommended to run the analysis on a computer cluster. For an example analysis, see files included in submap computer cluster analysis.
