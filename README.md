## BayesTwin
BayesTwin is an R package that can be used to perform bayesian analysis of item-level twin data. Simultaneously to the biometric model, an item response theory (IRT) measurement model is estimated. For dichotomous item data, the 1 parameter model (1PL) or the 2 parameter model (2PL) can be used and for polytomous item data, the generalized partial credit model (PCM) or the partial credit model (GPCM). Functions are included that help plot relevant information in figures and compute posterior statistics such as HPD intervals. 
 
Caution! To subroutines included in this package rely on the MCMC software package JAGS, which is freely obtainable at http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net. 

###Installation

Install JAGS (http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net) and Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/index.html). 

Then run in R:

install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)

install_github("ingaschwabe/BayesTwin")

Note: An error might occur when (an earlier version) of the package is already installed on your system (especially when you're using a Mac). In this case, deleting the package folder often solves the problem. The library path can be retrieved by calling the function .libPaths()
